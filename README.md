# Project Motivation

If you have ever been to a doctors office, checked in after making an appointment,
realized there was a wait, and then had to sit down and grab a magazine... all while checking
the time on your phone until you're name is called. With Clinity, you can skip the waiting line. 

Our Team has target common frustrations when going to the doctors office, and how you communicate with
your chosen practice. We aim to make online payment more transparent, scheduling an appointment a breeze,
and even chat with your doctor to answer questions for those with curiosity.
